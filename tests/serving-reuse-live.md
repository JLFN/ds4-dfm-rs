# HTTP reuse regression

`serving_reuse_live.py` only sends Chat requests to an already running local
server. The operator owns model startup, shutdown and cache directories.
Use a dedicated endpoint: any extra generation invalidates the route trace.

The fixture uses the actual returned assistant message, including reasoning
and whitespace.
Arithmetic correctness and byte-exact warm/cold output comparison are separate
checks. A wrong answer on both paths fails arithmetic even when parity passes.
Timings are functional observations, not a performance qualification.

The `literal-arithmetic-v2` answer contract declares four accepted strings per
case in `fixtures/serving-reuse.json`: the plain number, that number with a
period, and the matching literal equation with or without a final period.
Only outer whitespace is ignored for arithmetic acceptance. Operators, operands,
internal spaces and all other characters must match a declared string; there is
no numeric extraction or substring match. The accepted forms are copied into
the frozen case and its summary receipt. Tool calls and non-`stop` completion
remain failures. Visible reasoning tags or prose outside these forms fail.

Seed defaults to `--reasoning-effort none --max-tokens 32`. In a separate
campaign, `--reasoning-effort high` requires nonempty `reasoning_content`
and the same strict visible answer. `--max-tokens` accepts a positive output
budget. Both options are seed-only and freeze into every request body and
the fixture configuration; warm/restored/cold reject overrides. None mode
requires absent or empty reasoning. High-mode history preserves the actual
reasoning text, and cold parity compares it byte-for-byte along with content.

This gate qualifies these arithmetic answers and cache parity, not number-only
format following. The prompts still request just the number, so an accepted
equation can violate that formatting instruction. Earlier number-only runs
remain failures under their original contract: `2 + 2 = 4.` must not retroactively
turn such a formatting failure into a pass. Start a new evidence directory;
v7 refuses to resume an older frozen fixture. Never add answer forms after
seeing output within a campaign.

| Profile | Artifact scope | Warm reuse | MTP |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen` | Qwen3.8 Q5 main plus the selected BF16 or FP8 SSD-PLE sidecars | partial | explicitly off, or separately on with draft 2 |
| `solar` | Solar Open2 MXQ-v1, all 11 shards | partial | off |
| `motif` | Motif-3 MQ87-88-FIT canonical GGUF | partial | off |
| `naive` | Naive-N0.5-Flash MQ87 main plus any loaded DSpark sidecar | partial | off, or separately on with draft 1–6 |
| `iquest` | IQuest-Q1 canonical six-shard mixed artifact with embedded recursive MTP | partial | off, or separately on with draft 2–7 |
| `glm` | GLM-5.3 Flash Uncensored mixed artifact plus loaded Vision sidecar | partial | off, or separately on with draft 1–3 |
| `deepseek` | exact Flash/PRO artifact; include any loaded MTP/DSpark sidecar | exact | explicitly off, or separately on with the declared draft |

Provide the same verified artifact manifest to every phase. The runner records
its SHA256 and copies it into the evidence directory; it does not read or
rehash model weights. Owner imports and derived weight artifacts retain their
existing family launch requirements. Different artifacts or MTP settings need
separate evidence directories.

Use two banks, CUDA, context 2048 or larger, native prefill chunk 64, and no
other requests. The short fixture needs these settings on seed/warm/restored:

```sh
DS4_SERVER_CONTINUOUS=1 DS4_SERVER_FORK=1 \
DS4_SERVER_PIN_MIN_TOKENS=0 DS4_SERVER_PERSIST_MIN_TOKENS=1 \
./ds4-server --cuda -m "$MODEL" --model-id "$MODEL_ID" \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port "$PORT" --ctx 2048 --max-seqs 2 \
  --native-chunk 64 --prefill-chunk 64 --prefill-chunk-live 64 \
  --prefix-reuse partial --mtp-mode off \
  --kv-disk-dir "$CACHE_DIR" --kv-disk-space 2G --kv-cache-min-tokens 1
```

For DeepSeek, replace `--prefix-reuse partial` with `exact`. Keep the model's
existing owner/PLE/sidecar arguments. The server's requested lane is `auto`;
the runner's explicit `--lane continuous` checks the actual route. There is
no server `--lane continuous` option. Do not set `DS4_SERVER_CONTINUOUS=0`.
For an additional MTP-on run, pass `--mtp-mode on --mtp-draft 2` to the server
and runner, and `--expect-speculation on` to the runner. Solar/Motif reject on.
The runner rejects MTP on with speculation expected off. An arithmetic stop
after one token may precede the first draft; it cannot prove MTP execution.
After the five cold comparisons, every MTP-on campaign also copies the frozen
digit sequence `1234567890`. This probe requires the exact visible sequence,
at least two completion tokens, `speculation_active=true`, zero cached tokens,
the declared lane and no fallback. Its body, reasoning mode and token budget
freeze at seed. Leading/trailing whitespace fails this probe. MTP-off campaigns
skip it.
For Naive's short arithmetic gate, also declare `--mtp-margin 0` on the
server. Its default margin 3 can exclude every proposal on a short reply.
For IQuest, use `--family iquest`, declare the same draft 2–7 on server and
runner, and set server `--mtp-margin 0`. Its embedded MTP needs no sidecar.
Keep the [canonical-only owner recipe](../docs/iquest-q1.md#serving).
This profile describes runner support; IQuest live qualification is pending.

For Motif, set `DS4_MOTIF3_BATCH_TRACE=1`; for IQuest, set
`DS4_IQUEST_BATCH_TRACE=1`. Keep the flag on every phase's server, including
cold, and redirect stderr to a regular file. The runner reads only the new bytes from that PID's stderr
for each request; it records the file identity, byte range and raw trace hash.
Motif's official template removes the generation-only empty thinking pair, so
append/branch may restore a partial checkpoint at the canonical history
frontier. This is reported as `partial`, including when native code copies
that checkpoint to another bank.

For GLM, use `--family glm` and `DS4_GLM53_BATCH_TRACE=1`. Keep SSD/cache/Vision
settings identical across phases. Its canonical history can restore a partial
checkpoint after omitting the generation-only thinking close. Native trace
must prove a copy to another bank with the source frontier preserved. These
flags prepare a gate; completed live receipts establish qualification.

Start with an empty, dedicated disk cache and evidence directory. `$PID` is
the inference server PID, not its owner, shell or watchdog. Record clocks and
memory guard receipts alongside this evidence when running on the GPU host.

```sh
python3 tests/serving_reuse_live.py seed \
  --url "$URL" --pid "$PID" --output "$OUT" \
  --artifact-manifest "$ARTIFACTS" --family qwen --model "$MODEL_ID" \
  --context 2048 --banks 2 --native-chunk 64 --lane continuous \
  --mtp-mode off --expect-speculation off

python3 tests/serving_reuse_live.py warm \
  --url "$URL" --pid "$PID" --output "$OUT" --artifact-manifest "$ARTIFACTS"
```

For an IQuest thinking-mode campaign at the 8K/two-bank serving shape, use a
fresh evidence directory and cache, then seed with:

```sh
python3 tests/serving_reuse_live.py seed \
  --url "$URL" --pid "$PID" --output "$OUT" \
  --artifact-manifest "$ARTIFACTS" --family iquest --model "$MODEL_ID" \
  --context 8192 --banks 2 --native-chunk 128 --lane continuous \
  --mtp-mode on --mtp-draft 3 --expect-speculation on --padding-lines 64 \
  --reasoning-effort high --max-tokens 256
```

The server must use matching native and scheduler chunks and draft settings.
The receipt's `prompt_tokens` establishes the actual workload. Shorter padding
does not change the answer contract or qualify long-context behavior. The
earlier v4/v5 none-mode formatting, output-parity and trace failures remain
recorded failures; a fresh high-mode campaign does not replace them.

The operator then gracefully stops the worker and restarts the same executable
with the same artifact/settings/cache. Run `restored` as its first generation:

```sh
python3 tests/serving_reuse_live.py restored \
  --url "$URL" --pid "$RESTART_PID" --output "$OUT" --artifact-manifest "$ARTIFACTS"
```

For cold controls the operator starts a third process with the same shape,
chunks and MTP, `--prefix-reuse off`, and **without disk-cache arguments**:

```sh
python3 tests/serving_reuse_live.py cold \
  --url "$URL" --pid "$COLD_PID" --output "$OUT" --artifact-manifest "$ARTIFACTS"
```

| Request | Accepted literal forms (after outer whitespace trim) | Warm trace/cache |
|---|---|---|
| seed: 2 + 2 | `4`, `4.`, `2 + 2 = 4`, `2 + 2 = 4.` | cold, zero cached |
| append: 4 + 1 after actual seed reply | `5`, `5.`, `4 + 1 = 5`, `4 + 1 = 5.` | exact/fork, positive proper prefix |
| edit: replace second user turn with 4 + 2 | `6`, `6.`, `4 + 2 = 6`, `4 + 2 = 6.` | partial for Qwen/Solar/Motif/Naive/IQuest/GLM; exact/fork for DeepSeek |
| fork: extend the retained append branch with 5 + 3 | `8`, `8.`, `5 + 3 = 8`, `5 + 3 = 8.` | exact/fork, positive proper prefix |
| restart: extend actual fork reply with 8 + 1 | `9`, `9.`, `8 + 1 = 9`, `8 + 1 = 9.` | exact/fork as first generation after restart |

The warm phase must observe at least one actual bank fork. For Motif,
IQuest and GLM, the family-matched native trace must confirm a successful copy to a different bank, with the reported
cached count, unchanged source frontier and matching target frontier. A
`partial`/`fork` label alone cannot satisfy this check; an in-place rewind
cannot count as a fork. This demonstrates
the copy and frontier; tensor/source-content preservation is a separate native
gate. A full-prefix copy plus an in-place partial rewind does not establish a
partial checkpoint copied to another bank. Report that combination separately. Other families require at least one `fork` request trace. A later branch can
reuse its still-resident parent with `exact`; the scheduler need not copy a
bank again for that request.

Motif/GLM append/branch and Naive/IQuest MTP-on continuation/restart also
accept `partial`. MTP may commit a verified stop row that the retired text key omits.
Canonical token validation rejects a full candidate with a duplicated stop;
token-LCP reuse reports `partial` even when it copies the complete source
frontier. Positive cached tokens, actual speculation, a warm bank fork and
byte-exact cold responses remain required. v5 added IQuest's acceptance and
native fork evidence; v6 added frozen reasoning/output controls. v7 adds the
mandatory MTP execution probe. Older receipts remain unchanged and cannot
resume under v7.

Each arithmetic cold request uses the identical saved body, requires zero cached tokens
and `cold` trace, and compares the full assistant message, finish reason and
completion-token count against its matching seed/warm/restored response.
Two different accepted forms still fail this byte-exact comparison.
The additional MTP probe uses its seed-frozen body; it has no warm response to
compare and does not change the arithmetic histories or fork/restore checks.
The run also checks effective context, bank count, chunk, MTP and disk policy,
request lane/MTP/reuse settings, actual speculation and absence of fallback.
Both scheduler chunks must equal the declared native chunk.
DeepSeek's exact-only contract never counts an edited request as partial reuse.

Each phase writes process/binary identity, request/response/stats/summary files
and a result with hashes. Later phases verify the preceding fixture digest;
cold requests also match the original recorded request bodies. PID-to-endpoint
ownership is an operator assertion; the process receipt does not bind the TCP
listener to that PID. A phase with failed numerical or trace checks still
retains its requests for cold diagnosis and returns failure. Existing phase
records are never overwritten; use a new evidence directory for a new trial.
The final generated `fixture.json` is the exact replay fixture, including the
actual assistant replies. These short checks do not qualify long-context,
multimodal, tool, cancellation or throughput behavior.
