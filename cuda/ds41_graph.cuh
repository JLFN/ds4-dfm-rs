/* cuda/ds41_graph.cuh — decode-step CUDA graph primitives, ported from the C
 * engine at /data/YoungAi (commit 3946dbc), src/cuda/cuda_decode_graph.inc.cu.
 *
 * The engine captures a whole decode step (~1500 kernels) as one graph and
 * replays it with a single cudaGraphLaunch; the orchestration (when to
 * capture, bucket bounds, device positions, accounting) lives host-side in
 * ds4_ds41_graph.inc.  This file is only the primitive layer: begin/end
 * capture, launch, free, and the PDL edge rewrite.
 *
 * Port adaptations, named:
 *  - Stream.  The engine compiles -default-stream per-thread and captures on
 *    cudaStreamPerThread (every launch lands there).  The port launches on
 *    ds4_current_stream(), which is the legacy default stream (0) outside a
 *    capture -- and capture on stream 0 is forbidden by CUDA.  So the port
 *    captures on ONE dedicated stream created with default (blocking) flags
 *    and routes ds4_current_stream() onto it for the capture duration via the
 *    existing ds4_capture_set_stream.  The blocking flag is load-bearing, not
 *    cosmetic: the legacy default stream implicitly synchronizes with every
 *    blocking stream in BOTH directions (CUDA Programming Guide, implicit
 *    synchronization), so eager work on stream 0 -- notably v41_spec_rollback
 *    -- is ordered against a graph launched on this stream without extra
 *    events.  A nonblocking stream would NOT get that ordering and the next
 *    graph could read pre-rollback state.  Replay uses the same stream.
 *  - The routing must be restored on EVERY exit (failed begin, failed end,
 *    failed instantiate); a leaked routing would send later eager launches to
 *    the graph stream (the port's tensor-copy wrapper picks cudaMemcpyAsync on
 *    ds4_current_stream() while the routing is active).
 *  - Nested capture: the port's V4-era layer graphs share the same thread-local
 *    routing, so capture_begin refuses while any capture is active (the engine
 *    only ever had its own stream to check).
 *  - PDL edge rewrite is skipped below compute capability 9 (the engine only
 *    ever runs sm_121; on older devices the driver's error for a programmatic
 *    edge is not necessarily cudaErrorNotSupported, which the engine's
 *    per-edge fallback does not catch, and PDL does not exist there anyway).
 *    On sm_121 the rewrite and its fail-closed handling are the engine's.
