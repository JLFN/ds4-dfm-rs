# CUDA backend env-var reference

The CUDA backend (`ds4_cuda.cu`) mirrors `ds4_metal.m`'s role on NVIDIA. It
dispatches Q8_0 dense matmuls through one of three kernel families, has its
own n_tok=1 mmvq decode path, optionally captures the decode-block kernel
sequence into a `cudaGraphExec_t`, and can either allocate weight memory
in-process (default) or import it from the `ds4_weight_server` sidecar.

Every CUDA-specific env var is below, with the intent behind each default.

## Naive sparse attention

`DS4_NAIVE_DECODE_SCORES=0` restores the one-row two-pass QK walk.
The default caches rounded BF16 scores on chip before the V pass, preserving
the dot, softmax and value accumulation order.
`DS4_NAIVE_SWA_PREFILL_SCORES=0` restores the SWA walk above seven rows;
its default reuses the same scores with a 1-KiB tile per CTA. Wider DSA
prefill stays on the original walk because its larger tile loses occupancy.
`DS4_NAIVE_DSA_DECODE_TILE=0` restores the prior four-head decode cache;
the default uses one CTA per DSA head, four parallel QK walks and a shared
BF16 score/probability tile. Serial softmax and V reduction stay exact.
It only applies at width one with decode scores enabled; disabling
`DS4_NAIVE_DECODE_SCORES` still restores the original attention.
`DS4_NAIVE_DSA_DIRECT=0` restores modulo addressing for full DSA histories.
Its default removes that identity operation: the bounded forward keeps
every causal key below capacity. SWA retains wrapping. Buffers, arithmetic
and committed cache rows remain unchanged.

`DS4_NAIVE_SWIGLU_Q8=0` restores materialized BF16 SwiGLU before expert
Down. Its default emits identical D4 Q8 bytes directly for IQ2_XS Down,
2048→4096, 256 experts/eight routes and widths 32–8192. Input, SiLU and
product keep Naive's BF16 boundaries. Decode/verification and the Down
worklist tile stay unchanged; the fallback workspace remains allocated.

`DS4_NAIVE_INDEX_PACK=0` restores planar F32 index queries. Its default
packs four original dimensions per lane during the existing E4M3 round-trip,
then loads them as one vector. Reconstructed keys, four FMA steps, XOR dot
tree, signed head sum and stable top-k stay byte-exact. KV layout and total
allocation stay unchanged; query-producer stores become less coalesced.
This is a Naive-specific indexer layout, not a generic FP8 GEMM switch.

`DS4_NAIVE_INDEX_U2=0` restores one key per warp for packed Naive index
scores. Its default reuses each query/head-weight load across two keys only
for Warp layout, full 32-row query tiles and history above 2,048. Each key
keeps its reconstruction, four-FMA/XOR and signed head-sum order; odd or
noncausal second keys keep their original bounds and -Inf mask. Planar and
narrow rows keep the original kernel. Allocation and stable top-k are unchanged.

`DS4_NAIVE_SWA_DECODE_UNIT=0` restores the two-exponent softmax recurrence
for cached SWA at width one. Its default skips the exact unit exponent while
preserving serial order, FMA and BF16 boundaries. Nonfinite values use the
original recurrence. Prefill, wider verification and DSA stay unchanged.

`DS4_NAIVE_SWA_RING_WALK=0` restores per-key modulo addressing in cached
SWA. Its default computes the first slot once and increments/wraps it for
each pass, preserving early windows and physical KV addresses. It applies
at width one or above seven with score caching enabled; DSA and uncached
verification keep their previous addressing. Buffers and arithmetic are unchanged.

`DS4_NAIVE_ROUTER_WARP=0` restores the serial Naive top-8 scan. Its default
uses one warp per row for width one or greater than seven, retaining sigmoid,
selection-rank probability summation, normalization and numeric-ID ordering.
Any nonfinite input/score uses the original serial selection semantics.
Widths two through seven keep the previous kernel. No workspace is added.

`DS4_NAIVE_SUM_ADD=0` restores separate Naive expert sum and residual
kernels. Its default fuses MoE rows above seven, preserving ascending expert
order and every BF16 down/product/partial-sum/residual boundary. Dense layer
zero and widths one through seven keep the original pair. The validated F32
buffers must be disjoint; fallback scratch remains allocated.

## Qwen vision attention

On runtime `sm_121`, 72-value heads with at least 512 total patches use
four queries per warp to reuse K/V registers. Other devices retain two
queries; small inputs and other head widths retain their existing dispatch.
Per-key FP32 dot, online softmax and value accumulation order stay exact.
Blocks crossing image segments use the original per-row helper.
Eligible four-query blocks pack shared K/V into vector loads without increasing
shared storage. Packing is speed-qualified on Darwin GB10.
The same eligible shapes fuse QKV bias with RoPE by default, rounding each
bias sum before the unchanged rotation and storing biased V.

| Variable | Diagnostic control |
|---|---|
| `DS4_QWEN_VISION_QUAD=0` | Restore two queries per warp. |
| `DS4_QWEN_VISION_QUAD=1` | Force four queries on other CUDA devices for qualification. |
| `DS4_QWEN_VISION_PACK=0` | Restore scalar shared K/V loads on the four-query path. |
| `DS4_QWEN_VISION_PACK=1` | Enable packed shared K/V on eligible sm121 four-query blocks. |
| `DS4_QWEN_VISION_FUSE_ROPE=0` | Restore separate QKV bias and RoPE kernels. |
| `DS4_QWEN_VISION_FUSE_ROPE=1` | Enable eligible QKV bias/RoPE fusion; also the unset default. |
| `DS4_QWEN_VISION_LEGACY=1` | Restore the original eight-query block. |
| `DS4_CUDA_NO_QWEN_VISION_TILE=1` | Restore untiled per-row attention. |

The controls are read per dispatch. The untiled override takes precedence,
then legacy, then quad; packing applies within eligible quad dispatch.
Bias/RoPE fusion is independent of attention controls; unrecognized fusion
values retain the separate kernels.
Fresh Darwin GB10 evidence is recorded in
[`docs/qwen-vision-2026-10-02.md`](../docs/qwen-vision-2026-10-02.md) and
[`the follow-up`](../docs/qwen-vision-followup-2026-10-02.md).

## Qwen embedded MTP

The Q8 draft head scores low BPE IDs, non-normal token types and observed
MTP input IDs. The target head and acceptance verification use the full
vocabulary. Proposal hints are bounded by vocabulary size, reset with the
graph, and are independent of accepted KV state.

| Variable | Diagnostic control |
|---|---|
| `DS4_QWEN_MTP_FULL_VOCAB=1` | Score all draft vocabulary rows. |
| `DS4_QWEN_MTP_CPU_ARGMAX=1` | Download draft logits and select on CPU. |
| `DS4_QWEN_MTP_FULL_PREFIX=1` | Compute discarded attention/MoE outputs while preparing MTP history. |

Defaults use the compact Q8 head and GPU selection. Other draft weight
formats retain their full head; Metal retains CPU selection.
Prefix preparation normally computes only QSA index/KV history from shifted
target hidden states. Actual draft generation retains the complete MTP layer.

## Qwen fused QSA

Prefill widths above the decode split cap (8 rows) use one 256-thread
block per (row, KV head). The default PV loop maps twelve heads × one
dim per thread. `DS4_QWEN_QSA_PV6X2=1` selects the rejected six-head ×
two-dim mapping. `DS4_QWEN_QSA_NO_FUSED=1` restores the split scorer.

| Variable | Diagnostic control |
|---|---|
| `DS4_QWEN_QSA_NO_FUSED=1` | Per-slot scorer + serial/split reduce. |
| `DS4_QWEN_QSA_PV6X2=1` | Fused kernel, 6-head × 2-dim PV mapping. |
| `DS4_QWEN_QSA_NO_SPLIT_REDUCE=1` | Decode-width serial gqa12 reduce. |

All three are read per dispatch so a fixture can compare paths in one
process. Outputs match to fp32 reordering. `PV6X2` is a rejected
mapping kept for comparison; it is not the default. Selected-K/V
row-pair reuse was rejected (full-model logits drifted; no e2e gain).

## Q8_0 dispatcher

cuBLAS is initialised unconditionally at backend startup regardless of the
selected strategy: on sm_121 we observed that this triggers CUDA driver state
making mmq ~4&times; faster than a binary that skips `cublasCreate`, so the
cublas path stays resident even when not selected.

| Strategy | When picked                                       | What it runs                                       |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `mmq`    | default; every CUDA arch we've validated          | vendored llama.cpp `mul_mat_q` (`cuda/mmq/`)       |
| `cublas` | explicit override or fallback if mmq init fails   | `cuda_q8_f16_ptr` Q8&rarr;FP16 cache + `cublasGemmEx` |
| `warp8`  | explicit override or last-resort fallback         | native `matmul_q8_0_preq_*_kernel` family          |

Logged once on first dispatch, e.g.:

    ds4: CUDA Q8_0 dispatch: mmq (sm_120, 1792 GB/s memory bandwidth) [default]

The bandwidth figure is informational; we don't tier on it.

## Env-var inventory

- `DS4_STEP37_PREFILL_CHUNK=N` selects 1–4096 Step 3.7 prompt rows per
  chunk, capped by context. Default 4096. `2048` restores the capped-clock
  campaign control and leaves more memory for banks; the tested mixed
  image/bank configuration uses `512`. Invalid values use the default. The SWA
  ring retains an extra chunk, so both scratch and KV grow with it.

- `DS4_LING3VL_PREFILL_CHUNK=N` selects 1–4096 Ling-3.0-flash-VL prompt
  rows per chunk, capped by context. Default 4096. `2048` restores the
  previous campaign control. Invalid values use the default. Wider chunks
  grow routed-MoE scratch and the latent planes.

- `DS4_LING3VL_NO_BF16_VEC=1` restores cuBLAS for Ling n=1 BF16 projections.
  Unset uses the row-stable warp GEMV.

- `DS4_LING3VL_MLA_TILE=1` opts into the rejected shared-KV MLA prefill
  tile.

- `DS4_LING3VL_NO_MLA_EXPAND=1` restores the absorbed-MLA prefill (below).
  Unset, Ling prefill chunks of 64+ rows expand each 4096-key latent
  segment to per-head K (192) / V (128) with two BF16 batched GEMMs and
  run Motif's 192/128 range attention, merging segments through their
  log-sum-exp. The absorbed form costs 3.4x the attention FLOPs per
  head-key and fell to 32 TFLOPS at 64K. Decode (n = 1) stays absorbed.

- `DS4_LING3VL_MLA_KV_F32=1` restores FP32 expansion scratch, one-chunk
  key segments and Motif's range kernel. Unset writes the expanded K/V as
  BF16 (the GEMM output type), walks three-chunk segments so the LSE
  merges drop 3x, and runs the Ling range kernel (64-key tiles, ldmatrix
  fragments). `DS4_LING3VL_MLA_TK=32` keeps the BF16 path on 32-key tiles
  (slower; measured for the record).

- `DS4_LING3VL_NO_MLA_HMMA=1` restores Motif's SIMT latent attention on
  absorbed Ling prefill. Unset uses the dots3 tensor-core absorbed-MLA
  kernel (rows >= 8, 32-head groups, latent 512). Decode stays on Motif.

- `DS4_MOTIF3_ATTN_HG_FILL=N` sets how many times the head-group decode
  attention grid must cover the SMs before the key split stops doubling
  (default 2, max split 256). Motif's five 16-head groups already cover
  GB10 twice at the scanned 32 splits; Ling's two groups did not (64 CTAs
  on 48 SMs), so they now run 64 splits. `1` restores the fixed 32.

- `DS4_LING3VL_NO_BF16_REUSE=1` reconverts RMSNorm activations on every
  BF16 GEMM. Unset converts the packed row once per RMSNorm (prefill).

- `DS4_LING3VL_NO_BF16_PAIR=1` keeps two n=1 BF16 GEMVs. Unset pairs
  projections that share `b_norm` so the convert runs once.

- `DS4_LING3VL_NO_GEMV_XREG=1` restores the streaming warp GEMV. Unset
  caches the n=1 activation in registers so the K-loop only loads weights.

- `DS4_LING3VL_NO_MOE_FUSE=1` disables the Q4_K fused-silu helper. The
  Ling graph does not call it (decode A/B was Inconclusive).

- `DS4_MMQ_Q5_PAIR=0` restores two n=1 Q5_K routed gate/up GEMVs. Unset
  pairs them so the expert map and Q8_1 quantize run once. MTP verify
  (n_tokens>1) stays on two singles.

- `DS4_MMQ_VEC_SANITIZE=1` keeps the decode mmvq finite-scrub pass on
  Q4_K/Q5_K. Unset skips it for those types only; Q2_K/IQ*/Q8_0 still
  scrub. Q4_K/Q5_K vec outputs are finite on finite activations.

- `DS4_LING3VL_NO_F32_VEC=1` restores the 256-thread F32 n=1 GEMV. Unset
  uses one warp per output row for Ling F32 projections (router).

- `DS4_STEP37_NO_Q8_REUSE=1` disables exact post-norm Q8 sharing.
  `DS4_STEP37_LEGACY_TRIAL_HEAD=1` restores the redundant trial head;
  `DS4_STEP37_LEGACY_COMMIT_HEAD=1` reprojects committed logits. These are
  independent diagnostic controls for the [capped A/B report](../docs/step37-optimization-2026-09-13-r3.md).

- `DS4_STEP37_NO_SWA_HMMA=1` restores the warp walk on Step sliding
  prefill. Unset uses the GQA2 HMMA tiles already used on full-attention
  layers. EXAONE/K2 SWA stays on the warp path.

- `DS4_IQUEST_ATTN_SHUFFLE=0` restores the shared-memory attention
  reduction. The default keeps the same FP32 addition tree while replacing
  six block barriers with warp shuffles. Both BF16 output boundaries and
  the learned-key sink remain unchanged. Read once per process.
- `DS4_IQUEST_ATTN_WARP=0` keeps the retained 128-thread reduction for
  128-row full/SWA prefill. With tiled attention disabled, four independent
  head warps share each block. Wider tails and the draft window retain the old
  launch; single-row calls use the cached dispatch below.
  `DS4_IQUEST_ATTN_SHUFFLE=0` also disables this path. Read once
  per process.
- `DS4_IQUEST_ROUTER_WARP=0` restores serial expert selection for
  single-row calls. The default distributes the 256-expert/top8 scan over
  one warp, preserving lower-ID ties, first-unused NaN behavior and the
  serial selected-softmax normalization. Wider calls retain the old path.
  No extra allocation or persistent state. Read once per process.
- `DS4_IQUEST_ATTN_CACHED=0` restores retained shuffle attention for
  single-row full/SWA4096 calls. The default stages 128 compressed Q8 keys
  per CTA, then keeps the original key order, reduction tree, online FMA
  recurrence, learned sink and BF16 boundaries. It uses 34816 B static
  shared memory and no global scratch. Recursive window512 and wider
  rows fall back; parent `DS4_IQUEST_ATTN_SHUFFLE=0` also disables it.
- `DS4_IQUEST_ATTN_ASYNC=0` uses synchronous copies inside cached
  single-row attention. On SM80+ compiled targets, the default issues
  disjoint eight-byte asynchronous copies, waits for each producer, then
  synchronizes the CTA before reading the compressed tile. Arithmetic,
  tile size and allocation stay unchanged. The cached/shuffle parent
  fallbacks also disable this path. Read once per process.
- `DS4_IQUEST_ATTN_TILED=0` restores the four-head warp prefill path.
  The default uses TF32-pair tiles for 128-row full/SWA prefill on CUDA
  targets supporting TF32 MMA. Q8 KV stays canonical; bounded PV tiles
  merge in FP32 before ordinary BF16 output, then the F32 learned-key sink
  and second BF16 store. This changes arithmetic order and is not bit-exact.
  LSE needs 24 KiB of common temporary storage. Parent shuffle/warp switches
  also disable it; tails, decode and the 512-token draft window fall back.
  Read once per process. See the [measured numerical and speed scope](../docs/benchmarks/2026-10-01-iquest-q1-optimization-gb10.md).
- `DS4_MIMO2_SWA_DECODE=0` restores MiMo's one-row, window-128 attention
  walk. The default shares KV across eight query heads. `DS4_MIMO2_SWA_VEC=0`
  selects scalar copies inside the shared tile. Both accept `0` and `1` in
  ds4-perf. See the [numerical contract](../docs/benchmarks/mimo2-2026-09-24/README.md).

- `DS4_MIMO2_ROUTER_WARP=0` restores serial MiMo expert selection at
  widths 1–8. Unset uses warp reductions with the same lower-ID tie break
  and weight arithmetic. Wider prefill is unchanged.

- `DS4_MIMO2_SWIGLU_Q8=0` restores MiMo's materialized SwiGLU before
  IQ2_XS expert down. Unset emits the same unweighted D4 Q8 bytes directly
  for widths 32–8192 and the fixed 4096×2048, 256-expert/eight-route shape.
  Narrow decode and the existing down-sanitation diagnostic keep the old path.

- `DS4_MIMO2_SUM_RESIDUAL=0` restores separate expert sum and residual
  addition. Unset fuses these passes for widths 32–8192, preserving ordered
  FP32 multiply/add rounding and the final residual addition. Narrow decode
  retains the separate path; the existing dense-FFN scratch stays allocated.

- `DS4_MIMO2_ATTN_RESIDUAL=0` restores separate attention-projection scaling
  and residual addition. Unset fuses these passes for widths 32–8192,
  preserving separate FP32 rounding of the `0.707f` multiplication and add.
  The projection is not modified by fusion; narrow decode retains its old
  path. See the [paired A/B evidence](../docs/benchmarks/mimo2-2026-09-26/README.md#attention-scale-and-residual-fusion).

- `DS4_MIMO2_GATEUP_BOUNDED=0` restores the original IQ2 Gate/Up schedule.
  Unset bounds compiler scheduling between adjacent-k32-pair fragments on
  DGX Spark only, for M=2048, K=4096, 256 experts, top-k 8 and 2048–65536
  routed assignments (256–8192 tokens). Other shapes, architectures and
  narrow decode retain the original schedule. Cached on first use; compare
  fresh processes. See the [paired A/B and resource costs](../docs/benchmarks/mimo2-2026-09-26/README.md#gateup-bounded-scheduling).

- `DS4_MIMO2_INPUT_Q8_COMPACT=0` restores slot-gathered input quantization.
  Unset quantizes each token once for the aligned IQ2_XXS Gate/Up on DGX
  Spark, M=2048, K=4096, 256 experts, top-k 8, widths 256–8192. D2R reads
  those same Q8 bytes through the sorted token map; its accumulation order
  is unchanged. At width 4096 the input payload is 18 MiB rather than
  144 MiB, with no extra gather launch. Other shapes, narrow decode,
  disabled D2R and `DS4_MMQ_NO_YIND` keep the sorted format. A refused
  compact D2R launch rebuilds sorted Q8 before generic MMQ. Cached on first
  use; compare fresh processes. See the
  [MOPD A/B evidence](../docs/benchmarks/2026-09-30-mimo2-mopd-spark.md#prefill-1-direct-token-compact-q8).

- `DS4_MIMO2_DOWN_PIPE64=0` restores 128-column IQ2_XS Down worklists.
  Unset uses native pipelined tiles of at most 64 columns for unweighted
  fused MiMo SwiGLU Down on DGX Spark: M=4096, K=2048, 256 experts,
  eight assignments per forward token, widths 256–8192. Q8, dot arithmetic
  and output layout are unchanged. Generic IQ callers, narrow decode,
  disabled worklists, `DS4_MMQ_PIPE=0` and `DS4_MMQ_WORKLIST_TAIL64=0`
  retain the original path. Smaller tiles grow the worklist and weight
  reads; compare complete workloads in fresh processes.

- `DS4_MIMO2_VISION_ATTN=0` restores scalar full vision attention. The
  default caches scores in shared memory for interleaved Q32/KV8/HD64,
  1–8192 rows, without window, sink, causal or group masks. Other layouts
  retain the original path. See the
  [image A/B evidence](../docs/benchmarks/mimo2-media-2026-09-26/attn-score-cache/README.md).
- `DS4_MIMO2_VISION_COALESCED=0` restores the retained full-vision score-cache
  kernel for 512–3072 rows. The default stages K in a shared transpose tile
  within the same full-attention layout/mask predicate; rows outside that
  range retain the previous kernel. `DS4_MIMO2_VISION_ATTN=0` still disables
  both paths. This adds 8448 bytes of shared memory per CTA; see the
  [video qualification status and costs](../docs/benchmarks/mimo2-media-2026-09-26/video-attention/README.md).
- `DS4_MIMO2_VISION_WINDOW=0` restores scalar windowed vision attention.
  The default caches at most 129 scores for window 64 with sinks, using the
  same interleaved Q32/KV8/HD64 layout and 1–8192-row limit as full attention.
  Other windows, masks and layouts retain their existing paths. See the
  [window attention evidence](../docs/benchmarks/mimo2-media-2026-09-26/window-score-cache/README.md).
- `DS4_MIMO2_AUDIO_ATTN=0` restores scalar full causal codec attention.
  The default caches causal-prefix scores for separate Q/K/V buffers with
  16 heads, head dimension 64, stride 1024 and 1–8192 rows. Windowed/local
  audio and other layouts retain their existing paths.
- `DS4_MIMO2_DFLASH_CPU=1` restores host RMSNorm, RoPE and attention for
  MiMo's external five-layer DFlash drafter. Unset uses device kernels
  and shared K/V tiles. This control does not enable speculative decode;
  load the DFlash artifact with the existing `--mtp` and draft controls.

- `DS4_EXAONE_PREFILL_GQA=0` restores the warp prefill walk for
  EXAONE-family widths 2–63. Unset runs those rows through the decode
  GQA-pair kernel (`grid.z = n_tokens`). n=1 decode and n≥64 HMMA are
  unchanged.

- `DS4_INKLING_PREFILL_CHUNK=N` selects 1–8192 prompt rows per chunk,
  capped by context. The default is 2048.
  `DS4_INKLING_PREFILL_CHUNK=1024` restores the previous cap. Shorter prompts
  use only their actual rows; larger caps increase graph scratch. 4096 and
  8192 were slower than 2048 on the cold 8K MQ85GB shape.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_LINEAR=1` restores the separate stable BF16 projection and
  output-rounding kernels. Unset it to enable Inkling's token-grouped ordinary
  projections; router logits retain FP32. This diagnostic switch tests presence.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_MOE_BATCH=1` restores Inkling's per-token expert projections.
  Unset it for expert-grouped prefill on the validated MQ85GB shapes. Both paths
  retain canonical Q8_1 activation scales and the original MMVQ reductions.
  This diagnostic switch tests presence; one-token decode is unchanged.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_Q8_BATCH=1` restores per-token dense Inkling MLP projections.
  Unset it to reuse the existing aligned Q8 kernels at widths 1–8. Missing or
  disabled aligned artifacts keep the original path. Decode is unchanged.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_MOE_TILE=1` restores the four-column, four-warp expert batch
  kernel. Unset it to run warp-owned row/column tiles that decode each IQ2 or
  Q8 weight fragment once and replay the original lane, warp-partial and XOR
  reduction order. Same routing tables and activation bytes; decode is unchanged.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_SHARED_Q8=1` restores warp-owned shared-Q8 up tiles.
  Unset it for payload reuse with two shared experts and at least 16 prompt
  rows; from 64 rows, weight-resident tiles are preferred. Shared down,
  routed experts and decode keep their paths.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_SHARED_TILE=1` restores the eight-column shared Q8 up
  kernel. From 64 prompt rows, the default keeps each weight row in registers
  across all input groups. Unaligned Q8_1 input pointers or insufficient
  shared memory keep the prior kernel; every output retains its MMVQ reduction.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_SHARED_DOWN_TILE=1` restores warp-owned shared Q8 down
  tiles. From 64 prompt tokens (128 assignment rows), the default retains
  weights across input groups with the original one-warp reduction. Alignment
  and shared-memory limits fall back to the previous kernel.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_Q8_ROUTED_TILE=1` restores warp-owned routed Q8 tiles.
  From 64 prompt rows, the default keeps each weight row in registers across
  all input groups using the shared-expert tile schedule. Unaligned Q8_1
  input or insufficient shared memory keep the prior kernel.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_IQ2_SLAB=1` keeps the per-warp lean IQ2_XXS/IQ2_XS expert
  tiles (each warp job re-reads its eight activation fragments from L1).
  Unset it to let each CTA own one eight-column tile, stage the tile's
  activations once in shared memory (36 KB up at two CTAs per SM, 18 KB
  down at four) and sweep the row groups with four warps. Applies with the
  lean gate (256 prompt tokens) on aligned SoA weights. Outputs are
  byte-identical.

- `DS4_INKLING_ATTN_HMMA=1` opts into tensor-core prefill attention for
  widths of 16 rows and more: 64-query tiles of two heads, the current
  chunk's K/V staged as bf16 rows (a sticky device copy), 64-key tiles
  streamed through shared memory with cp.async, an online softmax per tile
  and probabilities as a bf16 hi/lo pair. Outputs differ from the default
  grouped kernel by fp32 summation order only (under 1% of bf16 outputs
  move by one ulp; the fixture bounds both against an FP64 softmax) and are
  chunk-invariant among prefill widths, but the model amplifies that to
  different greedy tokens, so prefill/decode parity is not byte-exact with
  it on. Decode and verify widths below 16 rows keep the exact per-head
  kernel; `DS4_INKLING_NO_ATTN_GROUP=1` bypasses it.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_SHARED_PIPE=1` restores the staged-slab resident Q8
  prefill tiles (the round-23 column kernel). Unset it to relayout the
  activations into int8 rows with float scales and stream them through a
  four-stage cp.async column ring issued two columns ahead; up keeps two
  rows per warp at two CTAs per SM, down owns four rows per four-warp CTA
  at four CTAs. Outputs are byte-identical.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_ATTN_PAIR=1` scores one key per warp iteration in the
  grouped prefill attention kernel. Unset it to load and score keys i and
  i+4 together (independent dots and butterflies) while the softmax scalars
  and V updates are applied in the release key order. Outputs are
  byte-identical.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_Q4_LEAN=1` restores the two-row branched Q4_K expert
  prefill tiles. Unset it to own four rows per warp, hoist the activation row
  out of the K steps and load every column (padding reads row 0, stores stay
  guarded); down caps registers for three CTAs per SM. Ragged row counts
  keep the two-row kernel. Outputs are byte-identical.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_SHARED_COLUMN=1` keeps the SoA slab of the resident
  shared/routed Q8 prefill tiles but sums all eight columns in one K loop
  (the round-19 kernel, 144 spill bytes). Unset it to run the K loop once
  per column with the activation scales converted to float once while
  staging; only one column's partial and merged sums stay live. Outputs are
  byte-identical.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_ATTN_TRANSPOSE=1` restores the all-lane head reduction in
  the grouped prefill attention kernel. Unset it to reduce the four head
  dots with a transposed butterfly (offset 16 and 8 steps split heads across
  lane groups, steps 4/2/1 and the online softmax run once per 8-lane group,
  alpha/beta broadcast for the V update). Each head's XOR tree pairs the same
  lanes in the same order, so outputs are byte-identical.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_Q3_TILE=1` restores the four-column Q3_K expert kernel,
  which re-unpacks the 3-bit values and scales for every column. Unset it to
  decode each row fragment once for eight routed columns from 256 prompt
  tokens (1536 assignments); lane products, FMA chains, warp merge and XOR
  tree are unchanged, so outputs are byte-identical.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_IQ2_LEAN=1` restores the branched column loop and
  table-driven sign masks in the IQ2_XXS/IQ2_XS expert prefill tiles. Unset
  it to load all eight columns unconditionally (padding reads row 0, stores
  stay guarded), hoist the row index out of the K steps, spread signs with
  `n * 0x204081`, and cap registers for three CTAs per SM from 256 prompt
  tokens (1536 assignments); narrower widths keep the branched kernel.
  Outputs are byte-identical.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_SHARED_SOA=1` restores canonical 36-byte Q8_1 slabs and
  float block deltas in the resident shared/routed Q8 prefill tiles. Unset it
  to stage the activation SoA (one 8-byte LDS per dp4a pair, conflict-free
  K steps) with half deltas, which fits two CTAs per SM for up and four for
  down. Outputs are byte-identical.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_IQ2_XS_ALIGNED=1` restores 74-byte IQ2_XS down tiles.
  Unset it to load owner SoA artifacts for Inkling fused w2 with the same
  MMVQ decode and reduction. Missing artifacts keep the raw path.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_IQ2_ALIGNED=1` restores 66-byte IQ2_XXS expert tiles.
  Unset it to load owner `--repack-iq2-aligned` SoA artifacts (Inkling fused
  w13 and ffn gate/up) with the same MMVQ decode and reduction. Missing
  artifacts keep the raw path. Decode is unchanged.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_Q4_TILE=1` restores four-column Q4_K expert batches.
  From 3072 routed assignments (512 tokens with six selected experts), the
  default reuses payload loads and unpacked scales across eight columns and
  skips the unused activation relayout. MMVQ sums and narrow paths are unchanged.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_LINEAR_TILE=1` restores the token-grouped ordinary BF16
  projection kernel. Unset it to run 16-token by 16-row CTA tiles that stage
  the token slab in shared memory; every output keeps the same lane stripe,
  FMA chains and XOR tree. Widths below 16 and K not divisible by 256 keep
  the grouped kernel. Decode is unchanged.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_LOGIT_TILE=1` restores the one-warp FP32 router GEMM.
  Unset it to cover the aligned output rows with the BF16 tile's raw sum
  and the same warp reduction for the leftover rows. The switch tests
  presence. Widths below 16 rows, an unaligned K, or a weight that is not
  BF16 keep the warp kernel. Decode is one token and stays on that kernel.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_LINEAR_PANEL=1` restores the original BF16 tile job order.
  Above 4096 prompt rows, the candidate schedules q/k/v/r/o output rows
  within internal 512-token panels (input width 4096; output 512/1024/4096).
  This changes kernel work order, not the prefill chunk. Other shapes and
  smaller inputs retain the original schedule.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_ATTN_GROUP=1` restores per-head prefill attention CTAs.
  At 16 or more rows, the grouped kernel scores the four query heads of a
  KV head in one CTA, reading each K/V element once per four heads with
  64-bit keys, 32-bit row offsets and prefetched keys. Decode and MTP verify
  widths keep the per-head kernel. Outputs are byte-identical.

- `DS4_INKLING_NO_Q8_TILE=1` restores the eight-column aligned dense Q8
  loop for the layer 0-1 MLP. The prefill tile keeps each weight row in
  registers while eight-token groups stream through shared memory, so a
  weight row is read once per call instead of once per eight tokens. Only
  K 4096/16384 use it, and devices whose dynamic shared-memory opt-in is
  below the 73,728-byte down tile keep the loop; outputs are byte-identical.

- `DS4_QWEN_PLE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/PLE-FP8` selects that directory's
  `ple-manifest.json` for the Qwen SSD-PLE loader. It supports the official
  FP8 E4M3FN sidecar without changing the main GGUF. Unset it to use the
  existing BF16 `ple/` directory beside the main GGUF. Missing or unsupported
  selected files fail loading. Use a separate disk-KV directory per main model
  and PLE format. See [FP8 PLE support](../docs/qwen38-ple-fp8.md).

- `DS4_MMQ_IQ2XXS_WORKLIST=0`, `DS4_MMQ_IQ1S_WORKLIST=0` or
  `DS4_MMQ_IQ2XS_WORKLIST=0` disables compact expert worklists for the
  respective raw IQ MoE prefill type.
  Enabled by default at 256 or more routed rows and
  32 or more experts; MMVQ decode and aligned-SoA pairs are unchanged.
  `DS4_MMQ_WORKLIST=0` also restores the rectangular schedule.

- `DS4_MMQ_PIPE=0` restores the upstream K loop in the compact worklist
  MMQ kernel. The default runs the IQ1_S/IQ1_M/IQ2_XXS/IQ2_XS tiles up to
  64 columns wide on the software-pipelined loop of
  `cuda/mmq/ds4_mmq_pipe.cuh` (next block's raw bytes prefetched into
  registers behind the MMA phase, both activation halves staged with
  cp.async one iteration ahead, two barriers per K iteration instead of
  four). Same dequantization and dots, so the outputs are byte-identical;
  128-wide tiles and every other type keep the upstream loop.

- `DS4_MMQ_IQ1M_PREFILL=0` restores the per-token IQ1_M MMVQ loop (one
  launch per token, same as HEAD). The default prefill path launches one
  assign-major grid with the same ncols=1 4-warp `vec_dot_iq1_m_q8_1`
  walk. It does not use `mul_mat_vec_q_moe` (ncols>1 drifted). Decode
  stays on the vec loop.

- `DS4_MMQ_IQ1M_SLOT_LOOP=0` restores the 3-D `(M, tokens, used)` IQ1_M
  grid. The default walks all top-k slots in one `(M, tokens)` block so
  the Q8_1 activation row is reused.

- `DS4_MMQ_IQ1M_WORKLIST=0` restores the assign-major IQ1_M MMVQ for
  prefill. The default runs IQ1_M gate/up on the compact MMQ worklist
  (ds4 `load_tiles_iq1_m`, per-16 Q3_K/IQ2_XS tile layout) at 256 or
  more routed rows and 32 or more experts; narrower shapes, the
  assign-major fallback and decode are unchanged. `DS4_MMQ_WORKLIST=0`
  also disables it.

- `DS4_EXAONE_ATTN_GQA=0` restores one decode-attention block per query
  head. The default shares each KV row across two query heads.

- `DS4_EXAONE_DOWN_SANITIZE=1` restores the standalone non-finite sanitize
  pass over the K2 routed-down output. The default skips it: the down
  output only feeds `moe_sum`, which skips non-finite values at read.

- `DS4_EXAONE_PREFILL_CHUNK=N` sets the EXAONE-family prefill chunk. K2
  defaults to 1024 since the 2026-09-05 campaign (512 before); K-EXAONE
  keeps 512 until measured. Larger chunks fill the compact routed
  worklists better and halve the per-chunk launches; the batch workspace
  and sliding rings grow with the chunk. Numerics move at the fp level
  (router GEMM tiling, attention accumulation order).

- `DS4_MMQ_IQ1_PAIR=0` runs K2 IQ1_S / IQ1_M routed gate/up as two single
  routed calls again (each with its own expert map, activation quantize
  and sanitize pass). The default pairs them like the K-quant gate/up:
  one map and Q8_1 activation, both compact worklists, consumers
  sanitize at read.

- `DS4_EXAONE_ROPE_TABLE=0` computes the NeoX RoPE angles inside the
  QK-norm/RoPE kernel again (double-precision trig per head and pair).
  The default builds one (cos, sin) table per prefill chunk or decode
  token and shares it across every layer's q and k call.

- `DS4_EXAONE_ATTN_SPLIT=0` restores the whole-context decode-attention
  block. The default cuts a full-attention context of 2048 or more keys
  into 256-key chunks, runs the f16 pair kernel per chunk (one block per
  chunk and head pair) and merges the online-softmax partials with a
  combine kernel. `DS4_EXAONE_ATTN_SPLIT_NATIVE=0` runs the Solar grouped
  split kernel (one block per chunk and KV head, keys decoded into shared
  memory) instead. Sliding-window layers, wrapped rings and graph capture
  keep the pair kernel.

- `DS4_FATTN_HMMA_LDSM=0` restores the scalar shared-memory fragment loads
  and the direct K/V tile fill in the GQA-pair HMMA prefill attention
  kernel (`cuda/mmq/ds4_fattn.cu`). The default reads the K and V
  fragments with `ldmatrix` / `ldmatrix.trans` (8 + 8 shared loads per
  16-key step and lane instead of 96) and, for BF16 K/V, stages the next
  64-key tile in registers while the current one is consumed. Both paths
  write identical bytes; the switch is a diagnostic rollback.

- `DS4_CUDA_MOE_HANDOFF_SANITIZE=1` restores the Q3 down sanitize after
  the IQ2/Q3 shared-map handoff. Default off: Solar `moe_residual` and
  EXAONE `moe_sum` already skip non-finite at read.

- `DS4_SOLAR_FATTN_WS=0` restores the GQA-pair kernel. Default on: the
  warp-specialized kernel (`ds4_fattn_hmma_solar_ws_kernel`) for Solar's
  K-FP8/V-FP4 prefill attention. Four producer warps stream raw K/V rows
  through a two-stage `cp.async` ring and decode them into double-buffered
  half tiles while eight consumer warps run the same 16-key HMMA /
  online-softmax steps. Byte-identical. Uncapped 64K on GB10 drew ~105 W
  and froze the host; keep the 300–2200 MHz SM cap on that class of host.

- `DS4_MODEL_ANON_HUGE=N` (Linux, default off; lives in ds4.c model_open, not
  the CUDA backend). Copy GPU-backend model files out of the file-backed mmap
  into anonymous `MADV_HUGEPAGE` memory at load. `N<=1` copies every GPU
  model; `N>1` copies only files of at least `N` GiB (e.g. `32` = base model
  only). WHY: the mmap'd GGUF leaves weights on 4 KB page-cache folios whose
  physical contiguity depends on how they entered the cache; on GB10 the
  GPU-side cost is decided at `cudaHostRegister` pin time — fragmented folios
  cost ~5x on routed-MoE spans, and even sequentially-rewarmed cache pays
  2-3.6x vs anon-THP (measured 2026-07-02: base decode 86-96 &rarr; 68.5
  ms/tok, w1 MoE span 0.276 ms = isolated-kernel floor). CAUTION: anon memory
  is unevictable — only enable when total copied bytes leave ~10 GB of true
  free RAM after banks/runtime, else the kernel splits the huge pages under
  reclaim pressure and performance lands BELOW plain mmap (measured: the
  95 GB base+MTP+drafter set on a 121 GB GB10). The copy streams with
  `posix_fadvise(DONTNEED)` so it does not compete with itself for RAM; boot
  cost is one sequential read of the file (~25 s for 81 GB on GB10 NVMe).
  A pressure guard skips the copy (keeping the file mapping, with a log line)
  when it would leave less than `DS4_MODEL_ANON_HUGE_MARGIN_GB` (default 20)
  of MemAvailable — the margin must also cover KV banks and runtime, and
  ctx-scaled bank growth at 32k+ can still exceed it.

- `DS4_MODEL_ANON_HUGE_MARGIN_GB=N` (default 20). Minimum GiB of MemAvailable
  that must remain after an anon huge-page model copy; below it the copy is
  skipped. See `DS4_MODEL_ANON_HUGE`.

- `DS4_WEIGHT_RESIDENCY=eager|lazy|mapped` (memgov D3-2; per-source
  overrides `DS4_WEIGHT_RESIDENCY_BASE` / `_MTP` / `_DRAFTER` win over the
  global). ONE typed weight-residency policy per model source, resolved
  once at engine open: `eager` (default) device-promotes the funded
  non-expert plan at boot with lazy backfill on misses; `lazy` defers the
  same promotions to first touch; `mapped` is TERMINAL host residency —
  mapped units never device-promote, and on integrated (GB10) the raw
  ATS-coherent mmap pointer serves them directly (capture-safe, no
  per-range registrations). Setting it beside a legacy residency lever
  (`DS4_CUDA_NO_HBM_CACHE` / `DS4_CUDA_NO_FD_CACHE` /
  `DS4_CUDA_DIRECT_MODEL`) is a strict boot error; with it unset the
  legacy shapes act as exact aliases (none = eager, `NO_HBM_CACHE` =
  lazy, `NO_HBM_CACHE`+`NO_FD_CACHE` = mapped, `DIRECT_MODEL` = mapped).
  The boot log prints the resolution:
  `ds4: weight residency: base=... mtp=... drafter=... (explicit|legacy-alias)`.

- HISTORY: `-DDS4_CUDA_SPARK_HBM_CACHE=1` (compile-time fork) is RETIRED
  (deepmem lite-2; plumbing deleted in D3-3). Startup promotion is
  compiled unconditionally, runtime-gated, and driven by the canonical
  unit materializer (the old `accelerator_cache_model_tensor_spans` walk
  is deleted). The substrate numbers that motivated device residency
  (measured 2026-07-02, per-stream): GPU streaming reads of
  `cudaHostRegister`'d host memory cap at ~161 GB/s while `cudaMalloc`
  device memory reads ~236 GB/s on the same LPDDR5x; base decode 63.3
  ms/tok with the walk vs 73-74 without. The whole-system re-measurement
  under serving load is the D3-1 rent gate (speed-bench/rent_gate.sh),
  which selects the release default. Promotion budget cap stays
  `DS4_CUDA_WEIGHT_CACHE_LIMIT_GB` (default 24).

- Range-lookup fix note (no env var; 2026-07-02): `cuda_model_range_ptr` now
  resolves device-resident HBM cache copies in a first pass before the
  whole-model registered mapping. Previously a single ordered scan returned
  the mapped (slow) pointer for every offset interior to a cached span —
  the registered whole-model range is pushed first — so only tensors that
  happened to start a merged span (in practice just the output head) ever hit
  the cache. This is why the HBM cache historically looked like "~10%".

- `DS4_CUDA_STAGE_PROF_LITE=1` (default off). Lazy-event GPU-span measurement
  of whole decode-forward stages (fwd/embed/attn/attncore/idxscore/cupd/emit/
  rbcp/ffn/moe/head), the MOE_PROF_LITE discipline generalized: event pairs on
  the current stream, non-blocking harvest on ring wrap, two stderr lines
  every 8192 harvests (`ms/call` per stage and `ms/fwd` = per-decode-step
  attribution). Valid in async production; nested stages overlap by design
  (attn ⊃ attncore/idxscore/emit ⊃ cupd/rbcp; ffn ⊃ moe) — subtract when
  attributing. Σ(fwd+embed+head) ≈ wall ms/tok when healthy; a gap means an
  unbracketed stage or launch bubbles.

- Budgeting note (no env var; behavior change 2026-07-02): on integrated GPUs
  the KV-bank budget (`ds4_gpu_mem_info`) now subtracts GPU-pinned
  *file-backed* weight registrations from MemAvailable. The kernel keeps
  counting pinned page-cache pages as reclaimable, so the old budget spent
  the model's own residency on banks — the measured NVMe-thrash mechanism at
  32 banks. Default bank counts on GB10 drop accordingly (the honest number);
  `DS4_SERVER_COALESCE_MAX` still caps explicitly.

- `DS4_BATCH_FIT_HEADROOM_MB=N`. Bytes the bank-count fit and the VMM
  comp-page budget leave free for runtime growth (tmp pools, capture graphs,
  logits staging). Ctx-aware default since 2026-07-03: 6144 for boots with
  `-c` &le; 16384 (GB10: +20% N=8 agg from the extra banks, N=1 neutral),
  8192 above (at 57k ctx the extra resident slabs steal page cache from the
  mmap weights and decode regresses ~7%). Setting the env pins one value for
  both regimes.

- Serving-path note (2026-07-03): `DS4_SERVER_CONTINUOUS=0` routes requests
  down the original graph-captured serial session path — on GB10 short-ctx
  this decodes ~11% faster at N=1 (56.5 vs 63.3 ms/tok) because the eager
  continuous-batch width-1 forward carries ~7 ms/tok of un-captured
  per-step overhead. It serializes the GPU per request, so it is a
  dedicated single-user setting only; the continuous default is correct
  for any concurrent serving. (This also explains the historical
  `DS4_CUDA_Q8_F16_PRELOAD` "win": the F16 copies starved the bank budget,
  continuous admission failed, and requests silently fell back to the
  serial path — the preload itself contributes nothing and is not a
  recommended knob.)

- `DS4_SERVER_DEFAULT_TEMP=<float>` (2026-07-13): temperature applied to
  requests that do not send one (default 1.0). Agent frameworks routinely
  omit temperature, and tool-calling requests are batchable greedy-only
  (`job_is_batchable`), so the 1.0 default silently routes them down the
  serial path — no continuous batching, no DSpark. `DS4_SERVER_DEFAULT_TEMP=0`
  makes omitted-temperature traffic greedy and therefore fast-path eligible.
  Requests that DO send a temperature are untouched. Pair with the
  `deepseek-chat` model alias (disables think mode) for agent clients:
  thinking also forces tools serial.

- `DS4_CUDA_PREFILL_PATH=mmq|cublas|warp8|auto` (default `auto` &rarr; mmq).
  Explicit override. `auto` and unset both resolve to mmq.

- `DS4_CUDA_USE_MMQ=0` (legacy alias). Equivalent to
  `DS4_CUDA_PREFILL_PATH=cublas`. The newer variable takes precedence.

- `DS4_CUDA_MMQ_MOE_MIN_TOKENS=N` (default 2). Minimum `n_tokens` at which
  the routed-MoE mmq path activates. At n=1 mmq's matrix-matrix-shaped path
  has higher per-launch cost than the vector path; that case is handled by
  the mmvq decode branch.

- `DS4_CUDA_MOE_SMALL16=N` (default 16; set 0 to disable). Direct routed-MoE
  vector tier for MTP/DSpark verifier widths 9..16 with top-k=6. It bypasses
  the MMQ tile path for these small batches and reuses the CUDA MMVQ/Q8_1
  vector machinery with internal column chunking above width 8.
  `N` may be 9..16 to cap coverage; `DS4_CUDA_MOE_NO_SMALL16=1` is an alias
  for disable. Since 2026-07-03 the tier applies to ALL models by default
  (`DS4_CUDA_MOE_SMALL16_ALL=0` restores the old MTP/verifier + small-Q4_K
  scope): base continuous-batch decode at widths 9..16 previously fell into
  the sorted/MMQ machinery and cliffed hard at n_live=9 (GB10 N=12 agg
  26.2 -> 41.3 tok/s with the tier; widths <=8 unaffected; quality-gated
  within score band on gsm8k/HumanEval/MBPP at conc 12). The larger Q4_K
  DSpark drafter still keeps its MMQ numerics unless SMALL16_ALL is set
  explicitly; `DS4_CUDA_MOE_NO_SMALL16_MTP_DRAFT=1` restricts the legacy
  scope to verifier forwards only. Widths 17..23 remain a known dead zone
  (fall back to MMQ, N=20 agg ~26 vs N=16 ~51 on GB10) — prefer scheduling
  decode widths <=16 or >=24. `DS4_CUDA_MOE_SMALL16_DIRECT=1` selects the experimental
  Q8_K direct fallback instead of preserving the normal MMQ backup path.
  `DS4_CUDA_MOE_Q81_FUSED=1` selects experimental canonical-Q8_1 fused
  gate+up+mid and down+sum helpers; early GB10 probes preserved acceptance but
  regressed throughput at wider routed batches, so this is diagnostic-only.
  `DS4_CUDA_MOE_Q8K_GATE_IN_VEC=1` and `DS4_CUDA_MOE_Q8K_DOWN_IN_VEC=1`
  are stage-isolation diagnostics: they keep the MMVQ branch active but swap
  only gate/up or only down to the Q8_K direct kernels.
  `DS4_CUDA_MOE_PAIR_RAW_VEC=1` selects an exact gate/up MMVQ diagnostic that
  quantizes X to Q8_1 once, runs the trusted MMVQ gate and up matvecs from that
  shared buffer, and leaves the existing clamp-aware SwiGLU kernel in place.
  `DS4_CUDA_MOE_PROFILE=1` prints per-call MoE stage timings for the fallback
  direct path and, in eager mode, for this MMVQ small16 path. For MMVQ timing
  runs, set `DS4_CUDA_LAYER_GRAPHS=0 DS4_CUDA_MOE_GRAPHS=0` so event recording
  is not inside a captured CUDA graph.

- `DS4_CUDA_MOE_NO_IQ2_ALIGNED=1`. Kill switch for the aligned-SoA IQ2_XXS
  decode path (megakernel program M1-Inc1). The path activates automatically
  at decode widths 1..16 (`136cec7` extended it past `n_tokens=1`) when the
  weight server serves repacked artifacts — DEFAULT ON since the 2026-07-04
  quality gate (gsm8k 97.4 / HumanEval 92.1 / MBPP 89.0 vs 97.6/88.4/90.0;
  disable server-side with `--no-repack-iq2-aligned`). The historical
  opt-in flag `--repack-iq2-aligned` re-serves the routed-expert gate/up stacks in
  a byte-neutral 64B-aligned layout (`[dq][pad][qs]`, replacing their raw
  ranges) and lifts the vec-tier gate/up rate from ~142 GB/s (66-byte block
  stride, 2x16-bit code loads) to ~215+ GB/s. With repacked artifacts
  present, raw-layout consumers (prefill MMQ tiles, widths 2..16) read the
  gate/up ranges directly from the client mmap through HMM instead of the
  device copy — correct, prefill-amortized, but slower per byte; do not
  combine a repack server with `DS4_CUDA_NO_DERIVED_WEIGHTS=1` (that hides
  the artifacts AND the raw exclusion remains, forcing every consumer onto
  the mmap substrate). Parity gate: `cuda/mmq/test/test_iq2_aligned_entry.cu`.

- `DS4_CUDA_MOE_NO_IQ2_DEREPACK=1`. Kill switch for the M1-Inc2b raw-layout
  device scratch. With repacked artifacts present, the prefill MMQ tile path
  no longer reads the excluded gate/up ranges from the client mmap; it
  inverts the repack device->device (`ds4_mmq_iq2_xxs_aligned_derepack`)
  into two persistent ~528 MiB scratch buffers, refilled per layer
  (~4.8 ms/tensor at ~233 GB/s), byte-exact. A/B on GB10, 15.2k-token
  prefill: 50-55 s vs 391-394 s on the mmap fallback (7.9x). One-shot boot
  log: `iq2 derepack scratch active`. Disabling restores the mmap-raw
  behavior above; decode (`n_tokens=1`) is unaffected either way.

- `DS4_CUDA_MOE_NO_Q2K_ALIGNED=1`. Kill switch for the row-pair-SoA Q2_K
  moe-down decode path (megakernel program M2). The path activates
  automatically at the vec-tier down leg when the weight server serves the
  repacked artifact (`--repack-q2k-aligned`, opt-in, REPLACES the raw
  `.ffn_down_exps` ranges at byte parity). Outputs are bit-identical to the
  raw `mul_mat_vec_q_moe<Q2_K,2>` path (proto_m2_q2k.cu: 240/240 parity +
  graph capture/replay); the twin reads at ~214 GB/s vs ~154 raw on the proto
  rig. One-shot boot log: `M2 Q2K aligned moe-down active`. CAUTION: with a
  repacked manifest the raw range is not served, so this switch drops the vec
  tier to the client-mmap raw path (~100x) — the real off switch is
  `--no-repack-q2k-aligned` on the weight server. The WS flag is DEFAULT ON
  since the 2026-07-05 quality gate (gsm8k 97.2 / HumanEval 91.5 / MBPP 88.5,
  within boot noise of the iq2/q8-flip 97.4/92.1/89.0; the twin is
  bit-identical). Needs clients >= `e221241`.

- `DS4_CUDA_MOE_NO_Q2K_DEREPACK=1`. Kill switch for the moe-down raw-layout
  device scratch (same contract as the IQ2 one above): with the q2k artifact
  present, the prefill MMQ down path inverts the repack device->device
  (`ds4_mmq_q2_K_aligned_derepack`) into one persistent ~672 MiB scratch,
  refilled per layer, byte-exact. One-shot boot log:
  `q2k derepack scratch active`. Disabling restores the mmap-raw prefill
  behavior; the vec-tier decode path is unaffected either way.

- `DS4_CUDA_NO_Q8_ALIGNED=1`. Kill switch for ALL aligned-SoA Q8_0 decode
  paths: the dense mmvq site (M1-Inc3) and the three custom warp8 kernels
  (M1-Inc4: hc_expand, q8 pair, grouped output_a). They activate
  automatically at decode when the weight server serves the q8 artifacts —
  DEFAULT ON since the 2026-07-04 quality gate; disable server-side with
  `--no-repack-q8-aligned` (345 artifacts, ~6.2 GiB, ADDITIVE — raw stays
  served, so every fallback is still a device read; one-shot boot logs
  `dense decode using aligned Q8_0 artifacts` plus three `M1-Inc4` lines).
  Inc3 alone was ~0.4 ms/tok (the dense mmvq site covers only a small span);
  Inc4 extends the layout to the warp8 kernels (21.2 ms/step of the serial
  decode) — proto_q8_warp8.cu shows +7-13% per kernel with bit-identical
  accumulation, and the combined e2e decode-only win is ~1.4 ms/tok on GB10
  (.33: 53.1 -> 51.7). With Inc4 the artifacts are worth serving for serial
  N=1 production, hence the default flip. CAVEAT: high-N continuous serving
  (decode widths >16, the MMQ tile path) still reads raw iq2 from mmap or
  pays derepack refills on a repacked manifest — keep a raw manifest
  (`--no-repack-iq2-aligned`) for that regime until the gap is closed.

- `DS4_CUDA_NO_HC_STAGE_FUSED=1`. Kill switch for the M2-Inc1 fused decode
  HC stage. Default ON when preconditions hold (Flash n_hc=4, F16 hc fn
  projections, decode single row, cooperative launch available): one
  48-block cooperative kernel with three `grid.sync()`s replaces the
  four-launch latency-floor chain `rms_norm_plain` -> f16 splitk matmul
  (16384x24) -> splitk combine -> `hc_split_weighted_sum_norm`, twice per
  layer (~40 us -> ~13.5 us per chain, proto_m2_hc.cu; ~-2.3 ms/tok
  projected on GB10 serial decode). Runs the dot products on the RAW hc
  input and applies the rms scale at combine time (mathematically exact,
  not bit-identical to the unfused chain — double-ref parity in-family
  with baseline). One-shot boot log: `M2-Inc1 fused HC stage active`.
  Disabled implicitly under `DS4_METAL_DECODE_STAGE_PROFILE` so stage
  spans keep their boundaries. Cooperative launches are captured into the
  per-layer cudaGraphs and replay bit-identically (proto-proven on GB10 /
  CUDA 13).

- `DS4_CUDA_NO_HC_Q8_FOLD=1`. Kill switch for ALL producer-emitted q8
  activation folds. M2-Inc1b: the cooperative HC-stage kernel's final phase
  emits the q8_0 codes of `attn_norm`/`ffn_norm` (bit-exact vs
  `quantize_q8_0_f32_kernel` — same butterfly reductions and rounding,
  proto_m2_hc.cu V4), and the next q8_0 pair consumer (attn q_a+kv, shexp
  gate+up) takes them instead of launching its quantize prelude — 2 fewer
  launches/layer. M2-Inc2a extends the registry with a q8_1 flavor
  (canonical block_q8_1, bit-exact vs the vendored `quantize_q8_1`): the HC
  stage emits ffn_norm's q8_1 blocks for the routed-MoE mmvq consumer and
  the qkv-rms kernel emits qr_norm's for the q_b consumer (hooks in
  ds4_mmq.cu skip `quantize_row_q8_1_cuda` on a registry hit) — 2 more
  launches/layer. Registry is encode-scoped, pointer+length keyed,
  pop-on-lookup per format, reset at every fused-HC-entry call. One-shot
  boot logs: `M2-Inc1b HC-stage q8 activation fold active (pair decode)` and
  `M2-Inc2a q8_1 activation fold active (mmvq decode)`. The q8_0 fold is
  implicitly off whenever the fused HC stage is off; the q8_1 folds are
  additionally off under `DS4_CUDA_NO_QKV_POST_FUSED`.

- `DS4_CUDA_NO_QKV_POST_FUSED=1`. Kill switch for the M2-Inc2 fused
  QKV-post kernels on the serial decode path: (2b) `head_rms_norm` + q
  `rope_tail` as one per-head kernel (device-scalars pos — the capture-safe
  twin of the long-dead host-pos fused kernel), and (2c) kv `rope_tail` +
  FP8 KV quantize + raw-cache store as ONE 8-block kernel (rope only
  touches the 64-float rotary tail, fp8 only the 448 nope elems — disjoint;
  the production fp8 kernel's 7 sequential 64-elem groups become 7 parallel
  blocks, bit-exact scales). Both fusions bit-exact vs their unfused chains
  (proto_m2_qkv.cu, plain+yarn rope, multiple positions, f16-round-trip
  store included). Also implicitly off when `DS4_METAL_GRAPH_DUMP_PREFIX`
  is set (the fused paths lose the Qnorm/KVrope intermediate dump points)
  and in reference-kv mode.

- `DS4_CUDA_NO_ROUTER_FUSED=1`. Kill switch for the M2-Inc3 fused decode
  router stage: the f16 logits matmul (4096x256), split-K combine, and top-6
  select run as ONE cooperative kernel (`router_fused_coop_kernel`, up to 128
  blocks; select-side bias/hash model-map reads prefetched behind the
  matmul), replacing three launches per MoE layer. Bit-exact vs the unfused
  chain (proto_m2_router.cu: 240/240 across bias/no-bias/hash, exact-tie and
  all-equal-logits cases, capture==eager). One-shot boot log: `M2-Inc3 fused
  router active (coop N-blk)`. Also implicitly off under any legacy
  router/f16 dispatch knob (`DS4_CUDA_SERIAL_F16_MATMUL`,
  `DS4_CUDA_SERIAL_ROUTER`, `DS4_CUDA_ORDERED_F16_MATMUL`,
  `DS4_CUDA_NO_WARP_ROUTER_SELECT`, `DS4_CUDA_NO_PARALLEL_ROUTER_SELECT`) so
  each of those keeps selecting the kernel it names.

- `DS4_CUDA_NO_COMP_PAIR_FUSED=1`. Kill switch for the M2-Inc5 fused decode
  compressor event: both pair f16 matmuls (kv + gate, 4096 x width), their
  split-K combines, and the compressor store run as ONE cooperative kernel
  (`comp_pair_store_fused_kernel<KS>`, up to 128 blocks), replacing five
  launches per compressor event at the three decode widths (1024 = primary
  ratio-4, 512 = primary ratio-2, 256 = indexer ratio-4).  On the fused path
  the emit tail runs via `ds4_gpu_compressor_update_tail_tensor` (the full
  update would double-store).  Bit-exact vs the unfused chain
  (proto_m2_comp.cu: 324/324 across widths x ape f16/f32 x pos sweep,
  capture==eager).  One-shot boot log: `M2-Inc5 fused compressor pair+store
  active (coop N-blk)`.  Also implicitly off under `DS4_CUDA_SERIAL_F16_MATMUL`
  and `DS4_CUDA_ORDERED_F16_MATMUL` (each keeps selecting the kernel it
  names).

- `DS4_CUDA_MMQ_X_MAX=N`. Clip `get_mmq_x_max_host` to N (rounded down to a
  multiple of 8) when sweeping tile widths. Diagnostic only; the vanilla
  128 wins on sm_120.

- `DS4_CUDA_NO_MMVQ_DECODE`. Opt-out of the vendored `mul_mat_vec_q` decode
  path. mmvq is structurally optimal for n_tok=1 routed-MoE and dense
  attention projection (one block per output row, no column-tile waste).
  Wires into `routed_moe_launch` and `cuda_matmul_q8_0_tensor_labeled`.

- `DS4_CUDA_MMVQ_DECODE_MAX_TOKENS=N` (default 8). Cap on n_tokens routed
  through the mmvq decode branch in `routed_moe_launch`. Range 0&ndash;8;
  0 disables. Values 2&ndash;8 extend mmvq coverage to short-prefill
  batches, subject to the `DS4_CUDA_MOE_VEC_MAX_ASSIGN` assignment envelope.

- `DS4_CUDA_MOE_GRAPHS=0` (default on). Opt-out of CUDA Graph
  capture+replay around the mmvq routed-MoE decode block and the n_tok=1
  dense Q8_0 vec path. Each captured launch is bracketed by
  `cudaEventRecord` / `cudaStreamWaitEvent` so g_moe_stream and stream=0
  stay correctly ordered across the boundary.

- `DS4_CUDA_LAYER_GRAPHS=0` (default on). Opt-out of per-layer
  decode-body CUDA Graph capture+replay. On by default since the Step 7
  determinism + perf gates passed: each transformer layer's decode body
  is captured into its own `cudaGraphExec_t`, keyed on layer index /
  token-flags / double-buffer parity, and replayed on subsequent
  matching tokens. Per-token state rides device-resident scalar
  substrates so it never enters the graph key. Verified bit-identical
  to eager decode through n=256 on sm_120 (PRO 6000) and sm_121 (GB10);
  decode-only, prefill is untouched. Set to 0 (also `off`/`no`/`false`)
  to fall back to the eager per-layer decode path. Also forced off when
  `DS4_CUDA_NO_MMVQ_DECODE` is set (the legacy non-MMVQ decode path is not
  capture-safe).

- `DS4_CUDA_LAYER_GRAPHS_HASH_DUMP=1` (default off). Arms the
  captured-decode per-kernel hash-dump diagnostic. When set, the
  `ds4_cuda_dump_hash_*` entry points FNV-1a a probed device buffer into a
  slot table and print one `DS4_HASH pos=N slot=I hexhash label` line per
  used slot at each token flush; when unset every entry point is a no-op,
  so a normal build is unaffected. Used to localize a
  captured-graph-vs-eager output divergence: probe the same prompt with
  and without `DS4_CUDA_LAYER_GRAPHS=0` and diff the `DS4_HASH` lines — the
  first `(pos,slot)` that differs is the divergent kernel. The probe call
  sites are added temporarily by the investigator (see the comment block
  above the implementation in `ds4_cuda.cu`); only the substrate is
  permanent. See also `tests/cuda_layer_graph_determinism_probe.sh`.

- `DS4_CUDA_MTP_VERIFIER_USE_MMQ` (default 0). Bisection switch. Normally
  `ds4.c` brackets every MTP verifier call with
  `ds4_gpu_set_mtp_verifier(1/0)` and the CUDA backend routes Q8_0
  matmuls onto `warp8` for the duration. mmq's stream-k + MMA FP32
  reduction order drifts ~1 ULP/layer from warp8; the drafter is trained
  against legacy decoding so an mmq verifier flips tight-margin tokens
  (0/314 acceptance on GB10 with mmq verifier active). Set to 1 to
  reproduce the broken behavior for bisection.

## DSpark / DFlash diagnostics

- `DS4_DSPARK_MAX_KV=N` (default 65536; 0 disables the gate). Production
  kv-depth auto-gate. Speculative decoding's advantage decays with context
  depth: acceptance drops as the sequence deepens while the multi-row verify
  forward's attention cost grows with kv. A bank whose
  kv frontier reaches `N` stops packing draft rows (verify = 1 row, plain
  decode width), is excluded from the block draft, and logs a one-shot
  `cont-dspark kv-gate` line; when every live bank is gated the step degrades
  to plain batched decode (no rollback capture, no draft, no ring injection),
  the same lossless path as `DS4_DSPARK_MAX_NLIVE`. The gate is one-way per
  request (positions only grow) and cannot affect output: the target verify
  forward remains the sole source of committed tokens. The default comes from
  the 2026-07-11 default-decision probes: spec still wins at 49k depth on both
  prose (1.10-1.49x) and code (1.19x), while the loss regime starts at ~64k+
  (prose 0.90x, 0.75x at 64-112k in the release frontier sweep; code reaches
  breakeven 1.02x at 65k). Structured content (code, math) keeps higher
  acceptance and crosses over latest, so raise `N` for code-heavy serving, or
  set 0 to always speculate. `DSPARK_PROFILE` reports `kv_gate_steps` (fully
  gated steps) and `kv_gate_saved` (draft rows suppressed by the per-bank gate
  on mixed steps).

- `DS4_DSPARK_ADAPT_GATE=1` (default off, experimental). Replaces the static
  `DS4_DSPARK_MAX_KV` cutoff with a runtime measure-and-switch controller.
  The static threshold is calibrated on prose, the weakest-acceptance content;
  structured/agentic content keeps acceptance deeper, so a fixed cutoff forgoes
  real wins there. Past `DS4_DSPARK_ADAPT_START` (default = `DS4_DSPARK_MAX_KV`)
  the solo-stream decode loop times a `DS4_DSPARK_ADAPT_RUN`-token window
  (default 512) in the settled mode, probes the other mode for
  `DS4_DSPARK_ADAPT_WIN` tokens (default 64), and keeps whichever decodes
  faster with `DS4_DSPARK_ADAPT_MARGIN_PCT` (default 3) hysteresis, re-probing
  every cycle so content shifts mid-generation re-open the decision. Below the
  start depth it is dormant (pure spec, zero overhead). Engages only at
  `n_live==1` (the production `DS4_DSPARK_MAX_NLIVE=1` regime). Unlike the
  static gate, spec can re-enter, so ring injection and the capture tap stay on
  during spec-off windows (re-entry across ring holes collapses acceptance);
  the hard gate and its injection skip are inert while this mode is on.
  Lossless either way — the verify forward remains the sole token source.
  Logs `adapt-gate ENGAGED` once per request and each mode switch (first 8);
  `DSPARK_PROFILE` reports `ad_probes`/`ad_switches`/`ad_plain_steps`.

- `DS4_DSPARK_QUENCH` (default ON; `=0` disables). Terminal per-request yield
  quench: each verify step accumulates cumulative regret
  `debt += guard − tokens_committed` per bank (no clamp — surplus from good
  steps banks credit); once `spec_steps ≥ minev`, `yield_EWMA < guard`, and
  `debt > budget`, speculation turns off for the rest of that request via the
  kv-gate's lossless per-bank nd=0 path (reset at admit). Bounds low-accept
  requests at ~0.96× plain (always-spec floor was 0.72× on deep prose) while
  leaving winners untouched. Calibrated defaults guard 2.22 / alpha 0.125 /
  minev 4 / budget 4.0 / credit cap ∞, overridable via
  `DS4_DSPARK_SHADOW_{GUARD,ALPHA,MINEV,BUDGET,CREDIT_CAP}` (shared with the
  trace shadow). Supersedes `DS4_DSPARK_ADAPT_GATE` when both are set. Logs
  `yield-quench bank=... -> spec off for this seq (terminal)`; `DSPARK_PROFILE`
  reports `quench_steps`/`quench_saved`.

- `DS4_DSPARK_QUENCH_FORCE_STEP=N` (testing). With quench on, force-quench
  every bank at its Nth spec step regardless of yield (0 = at admit — the
  whole request runs the terminal-plain path; used for the plain-identity
  gate). Disables the policy trigger.

- `DS4_DSPARK_TRACE=1` (default off). Per-request per-step telemetry:
  `DSPARK_TRACE` (yield/comparisons/packed-drafts/n_live/spec/step-ms records)
  and `DSPARK_SHADOW` (the quench arithmetic replayed over the request).
  Feeds `tools/dspark_trace_replay.py` (`validate` proves trace totals equal
  `CONT_MTP_ACCEPT` exactly; `replay --grid` calibrates quench parameters
  offline; `inspect`; `selftest`).

- `DS4_DSPARK_PROFILE=1` (default off). Print aggregate DSpark continuous
  decode timings split into verifier forward, accept loop, inject pack,
  inject projection, inject store, rollback, deferred commit, block draft,
  and Markov refine. Use with `DS4_CONT_PROFILE=1` when comparing against
  whole-engine forward/sample buckets.

- `DS4_DSPARK_COMPACT_INJECT=1` (default off). Diagnostic path that injects
  only accepted verifier rows into the DSpark KV rings instead of every
  verifier row. It packs captured target hidden rows with a CUDA gather
  kernel before the existing DSpark projection/inject stages. Intended to
  quantify whether rejected-row injection is material.

- `DS4_DSPARK_VERIFY_DEPTH=N` (range `1..4`). Diagnostic speed/acceptance
  dial for DSpark block verify width. Unset uses the production policy:
  verify all four drafts at `n_live<=2`, verify three drafts at `n_live==3`,
  and let the existing `DS4_DSPARK_MAX_NLIVE` gate disable DSpark above that.
  When set, the value is exact and disables the `n_live==3` auto-depth rule.
  The block drafter still generates four candidate drafts; this dial controls
  how many are consumed by the verifier on the next step.

- `DS4_DSPARK_ADAPT_DEPTH=1` (default off). Diagnostic per-bank verify-depth
  controller. Each live bank shrinks its next verifier width after a miss and
  grows it after accepting the full currently verified prefix. Correctness is
  unchanged because accepted tokens still come only from the target verifier;
  this only trades verifier rows against draft yield.

## In-process VMM weight arena

The arena allocates each weight tensor in its own CUDA Driver VMM
region (`cuMemCreate` &rarr; `cuMemAddressReserve` &rarr; `cuMemMap`
&rarr; `cuMemSetAccess`), giving every tensor its own
2&nbsp;MiB-aligned virtual address.  This matches what the
out-of-process `ds4_weight_server` provides imported workers.  On
discrete GPUs this is worth roughly 2&times; prefill; on integrated
GPUs it's neutral-to-positive.

### Why per-tensor chunks specifically

The chunk-size bisect we ran during development clarified the
mechanism.  VMM with one large chunk (e.g.
`DS4_CUDA_VMM_ARENA_CHUNK_MB=1792`) performs identically to the
cudaMalloc-backed arena (~1080 t/s prefill on PRO 6000), even though
the underlying memory is still 2&nbsp;MiB-paged.  The actual
differentiator is **per-tensor 2&nbsp;MiB-aligned base addresses**:
when each weight tensor sits at its own fresh
`cuMemAddressReserve`-handed VA, matmul kernels' tile-load coalescing
and L2 spatial-locality patterns improve enough to roughly double
prefill.  Pack the same VMM-paged memory into one big chunk and the
bases land at sub-granularity offsets &mdash; the perf advantage
disappears.

This also unifies cleanly with the drift below: same root cause, two
effects you cannot separate.

### Known trade-off: FP32 reduction-order drift vs official vectors

Per-tensor VMM-allocated weight ranges produce a small but real
**reduction-order drift** in the matmul kernels relative to the
cudaMalloc-backed arena.  The same cache/tile-arrival-order behavior
that gives the 2&times; perf win also changes the order in which tile
partial sums reach the FP32 accumulator; FP32 is non-associative, so
the order matters.  This is structural to the kernels' parallel
reduction strategy, not a misuse of the API.

Investigation established:

1. The uploaded weight bytes are byte-identical between the two
   allocators (verified by post-upload checksum of all 138 weight
   ranges).
2. Kernels do not read past tensor bounds (verified by poisoning the
   chunk tail with 0xAB instead of zero &mdash; output unchanged).
3. The drift is shared by both the vendored mmq family and the legacy
   `warp8` native kernels and is therefore upstream of the Q8_0
   dispatcher.  Same drift on PRO 6000 sm_120 and GB10 sm_121.
4. Logit-level magnitude is small (~0.08 logprob units at step 0)
   &mdash; bounded, deterministic, of the same shape as the documented
   mmq-vs-warp8 ULP-per-layer drift behind `DS4_CUDA_MTP_VERIFIER_USE_MMQ`
   (Option D).  Most tokens are unaffected; only tight-margin choices
   flip.

**Observable cost:** in `./ds4_test --logprob-vectors`, one of four
test vectors (`short_code_completion`, step 1: the `c` language tag
after triple-backticks) flips to a textually-equivalent but
byte-different alternative under the VMM-arena default.  The other
seven failures in that test family are pre-existing on the CUDA
backend and reproduce identically with `DS4_CUDA_VMM_ARENA=0`.

**Workaround for users who need official-vector byte equivalence:**
set `DS4_CUDA_VMM_ARENA=0` to use the cudaMalloc-backed arena.  Prefill
ceiling drops by ~50% on discrete GPUs in exchange for the parity.

### Env vars

- `DS4_CUDA_VMM_ARENA=0`. Disable; fall back to the cudaMalloc-backed
  arena.  Also the workaround for the reduction-order drift above.

- `DS4_CUDA_VMM_ARENA_CHUNK_MB=N`. Minimum chunk size per `cuMemCreate`.
  Default 0 (chunk = request size, rounded up to the driver-reported
  granularity; matches the weight server's per-range allocation).
  Values 1024+ collapse the per-tensor placement and forfeit the perf
  benefit; useful only for bisection.

- `DS4_CUDA_WEIGHT_IPC_MANIFEST=/path/to/manifest.json`. Worker-side
  import path for weights owned by `ds4_weight_server`. When set, the
  in-process VMM arena is hard-gated off because the sidecar already
  provides identical VMM ranges and running both would double-allocate
  the model. See `misc/proof-harness/README.md` for the sidecar
  lifecycle.

- `DS4_GLM53_LOW_ATTN=0` restores reference GLM-5.3 compact attention.
  Default enabled: pair latent outputs only for selected2051/128-row/
  64-head/latent512 prefill. Preserve each output's FMA order; no added
  workspace. Decode and other shapes keep the reference kernel. The
  unrestricted pair path regressed whole-model decode and was rejected.
- `DS4_GLM53_LOW_ATTN_WIDE=0` restores reference attention for 129–2048 rows.
  Default enabled for selected 2051/64-head/latent512 prefill; preserve each
  output's FMA order. Decode and other shapes retain the reference.
- `DS4_GLM53_GATE_UP_PAIR=0` restores separate mixed gate/up preparation.
  Default enabled above 8 rows for raw/padded IQ2_XXS, IQ2_XS and Q4_K pairs.
  Share Q8_1 activations and routing maps without weight repacking. Same-width
  outputs are exact; small-width Decode keeps its existing path.
- `DS4_GLM53_DENSE_GEMM=1` enables diagnostic dense Tensor Core attention.
  Default Off: FP16 Q/probability with FP32 accumulation passes its rounded
  reference but loses two codes in the recorded 6K retrieval at 2048 rows.
  Dense rows 128–2048/keys<=2051 only; sparse and Decode remain unchanged.
- `DS4_GLM53_PREFILL_ROWS=N` requests 1–2048 physical rows (default 2048).
  Rust fits workspace against weights, active KV/state, checkpoints, media
  and reserve; it reports the effective width while preserving context/banks.
- `DS4_GLM53_PREFILL_WINDOW=0` disables checkpoint-aligned layer-major
  SSD Prefill. Default On when eligible; GEMMs remain <=2048 rows. One bank,
  rows >=128 and at least two full expert layers are required. Short appends,
  two banks and smaller caches use selected-expert supply. Rust publishes 0
  when the admitted plan cannot use the window, including serial media graphs.
- `DS4_GLM53_PREFETCH=0` disables whole-next-layer supply inside
  the layer-major window. Default On; two staging groups share the expert
  budget, with one bounded pageable reader and a separate CUDA upload stream.
- `DS4_GLM53_HOT_CACHE=0` disables recent-route retention during
  selected-expert Prefill. Default On; protect the last 8 rows of each layer
  only when capacity also leaves one complete layer free. No added workspace.
  Same-width logits/tokens are exact. The recorded 24 GiB 2K A/B reduces first
  Decode-token waiting and improves sustained Decode without added storage.
  See `docs/glm53-prefill-2026-10-08.md` for the adoption and workload boundary.
- `DS4_GLM53_HOT_COPY=0` restores last-eight-row grouped cache retention.
  Default On fills the funded hot area from recent unique routes across
  physical chunks. It adds weight copies without enlarging the GPU pool.
- `DS4_GLM53_HOT_LAST=0` copies grouped hot weights after every window.
  Default On skips intermediate copies without a requested logits frontier.
  The fixed 10000-slot 8K+64 A/B improves whole latency 1.35%, with 2.6% lower
  Prefill throughput and 65.1% higher Decode. See the campaign for scope.
- `DS4_GLM53_POOL_WARP=0` restores reference GLM-5.3 pooled index scores.
  Default enabled for32 heads: compute independent heads in separate warps,
  preserving the original dot-product tree and ordered head sum. No added
  workspace; registers/key reads increase while synchronization decreases.
  Other head counts retain the reference kernel.
  See `docs/glm53-uncensored.md` for the matched resident A/B boundary.
- `DS4_GLM53_SHARED_Q8=0` restores separate GLM shared gate/up and SwiGLU.
  Default enabled only for eager Spark decode, raw Q8_0, K4096/M2048 and
  clamp10. Quantize Q8_1 once; preserve each dot and the four-warp tree.
  Aligned artifacts, capture and other shapes retain the reference path.
  No global workspace growth; paired static shared memory is768B.
  Three fresh2K pairs improve decode0.27–0.47%;8K remains within variation.
